- Timelock controller for critical operations
- Role admin controlled by timelock

### 2. Input Validation
- All external functions validate inputs
- Address zero checks
- Amount bounds checking
- String length limits
- Array size limits

### 3. Reentrancy Protection
- ReentrancyGuard on all state-changing functions
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

### 4. Upgrade Security
- UUPS pattern with upgrade authorization
- Only timelock can authorize upgrades
- Storage gap for future upgrades

### 5. Compliance Features
- KYC/AML verification required
- Jurisdiction restrictions
- Investment limits
- Maximum holder limits
- Lockup periods

### 6. Emergency Controls
- Pause functionality for emergencies
- Emergency withdrawal for stuck funds
- Controlled by specific roles

## Best Practices
