# Finatrades RWA Token - Audit Documentation

## Executive Summary

The Finatrades RWA Token is an ERC-1400 compliant security token designed for tokenizing real-world assets, specifically real estate properties in Asian and African markets. The contract implements comprehensive compliance features, property management, and dividend distribution mechanisms.

## Contract Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Main Contract**: `FinatradesRWA_Final.sol`
   - ERC-20 base functionality
   - ERC-1400 partition management
   - Snapshot mechanism for dividends
   - Access control and pausability
   - UUPS upgradeability

2. **Libraries**:
   - `PropertyLib.sol`: Property management logic
   - `ComplianceLib.sol`: KYC/AML compliance
   - `JurisdictionLib.sol`: Jurisdiction management

### Key Features

#### 1. Property Tokenization
- Support for multiple property types (residential, commercial, industrial)
- Property metadata storage (valuation, address, legal description)
- Rental income tracking
- Property lifecycle management (active → for sale → sold)

#### 2. ERC-1400 Compliance
- **Partitions**: Separate property types/classes
- **Document Management**: On-chain document registry
- **Transfer Restrictions**: Granular control with reason codes
- **Controller Operations**: Emergency transfers

#### 3. Investor Management
- KYC/AML verification with expiry
- Investor types (retail, qualified, institutional, professional)
- Jurisdiction restrictions (Asia & Africa only)
- Investment limits (min/max)

#### 4. Dividend Distribution
- Snapshot-based distribution
- Property-specific dividends
- Batch claiming functionality
- Protection against double claims

#### 5. Security Features
- Multi-role access control
- Reentrancy protection
- Rate limiting
- Emergency stop mechanism
- Timelock governance

## Security Considerations

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE | Grant/revoke roles, emergency functions |
| CONTROLLER_ROLE | Pause/unpause, force transfers |
| COMPLIANCE_ROLE | Manage investors, jurisdictions, limits |
| MINTER_ROLE | Issue new tokens |
| CORPORATE_ACTIONS_ROLE | Deposit dividends |
| PROPERTY_MANAGER_ROLE | Add/update properties |
| UPGRADER_ROLE | Authorize upgrades |

### Security Mechanisms

1. **Input Validation**
   - All external functions validate parameters
   - Bounds checking on amounts
   - Address validation (no zero addresses)
   - String length limits

2. **State Management**
   - Reentrancy guards on all state-changing functions
   - Proper state updates before external calls
   - Check-effects-interactions pattern

3. **Emergency Controls**
   - Pause mechanism for all transfers
   - Emergency stop with time delay
   - Emergency withdrawal for stuck funds

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Max 100 transactions per hour per address
   - Prevents spam and DoS attacks

## Deployment Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

### 2. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:bsc-testnet

# Deploy to mainnet
npm run deploy:bsc
```

## Example Deployed Contracts (BSC Testnet)

These contracts are deployed on BSC Testnet for testing purposes:

| Contract | Address | Explorer Link |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Timelock Controller | `0x90c02646D2aC337082b0058158954Cb8dFF62985` | [View on BscScan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x90c02646D2aC337082b0058158954Cb8dFF62985) |
| RWA Token (Proxy) | `0xd8Fd81832daFd721ac5f1Ab21b8e78e1AaaaAE4c` | [View on BscScan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xd8Fd81832daFd721ac5f1Ab21b8e78e1AaaaAE4c) |
| Implementation | `0x3eAf6dC0C7D7C82C6f650b407F899E85Ea880487` | [View on BscScan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x3eAf6dC0C7D7C82C6f650b407F899E85Ea880487) |

**Note**: These are testnet contracts for demonstration only. Do not send real funds to these addresses.

### 3. Post-Deployment
1. Initialize jurisdictions
2. Set compliance parameters
3. Register initial properties
4. Transfer admin to timelock

## Gas Optimization

### Implemented Optimizations
1. Using enums instead of strings for property types/status
2. Packed struct storage
3. Minimal string usage
4. Batch operations where possible

### BSC Deployment
- Contract size: ~35KB (within BSC limits)
- Deployment gas: ~8M gas
- Average transfer: ~100K gas
- Dividend claim: ~150K gas

## Known Limitations

1. **Contract Size**: Full ERC-1400 implementation exceeds Ethereum mainnet limits but works on BSC
2. **Jurisdiction Updates**: Adding new jurisdictions requires governance action
3. **Dividend Precision**: May lose small amounts due to rounding
